## 1. Control-q

1) cqtick.q - replacement for tick.q that uses timestamps (date and time), automatically rolling tp log files, updates as tables or lists, async broadcast, auto-cutoff of slow consumers
2) cqrdb.q - rdb that does priority based failover between tickerplants.
3) cqtimer.q - a timer library


## 2. Apecoin
